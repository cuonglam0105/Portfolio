# Portfolio_Marketing_Funnels


Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world — for every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, my task is analyzing different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that i am given:

Quiz Funnel:
+ survey

Home Try-On Funnel:
+ quiz
+ home_try_on
+ purchase

=============================================

The purchase funnel is:

Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses

During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:

50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on

Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on 
at home will be more likely to make a purchase.
